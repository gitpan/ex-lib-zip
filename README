ex::lib::zip version 0.04
=========================

An extension to let you C<use> things direct from zip files direct.
No temporary files.  No subprocesses.

For example

  use ex::lib::zip 'library.zip'; # A zip file that contains a file Foo.pm
  use Foo; # And perl will get Foo.pm from library.zip.


Yes, you can use the <DATA> filehandle from modules inside the zip. Your
data will be uncompressed.

Yes, you can use SelfLoader inside the zip.

Yes, you can use AutoLoader inside the zip, provided you zip up the auto/...
tree

Yes, you can even put the zip file in your script, to package your modules
with your script in one file. Like this

  BEGIN {
    eval "use ex::lib::zip q($0)";
  }
  use Foo;
  __END__
  ... your zip containing Foo.pm (etc) goes here.

(although, of course, your target perl will need this module installed already)
