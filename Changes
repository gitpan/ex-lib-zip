      Was leaking a scalar for each zip stored file encountered, as the
      result of newSVpvf never had its refcount decreased.
      Now re-written this section at the end of findfile() to build an AV
      and call the new PerlIO_apply_layera() function. The argument to the
      PerlIO::subfile layer is now a UV, which saves converting a number to and
      from a string.
      Added make-zips.pl to the MANIFEST, which had been forgotten.
      Tweak the Makefile.PL so that make-zips.pl and pushme.pl don't get
      spotted and hence installed. (They aren't meant to be installed)
